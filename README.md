particle simulations!

not all of them work because I keep breaking them, but there are ones for:
gasses
ideal gases, real gasses nonrelativistic/reletivistic grav sims
nuclear apparently?

some of them try to implement CUDA and JIT to speed up the n-body sims especially as N climbs into the hundreds or thousands, but this has its own litany of issues, especially w/ floating point error
